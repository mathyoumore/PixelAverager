PixelAverager is a... pixel averager script which scans over an image and generates one of three treated images.

hMean (Horizontal Mean): Starting on the top row, hMean samples every pixel in a column, gathering the red, green, and blue values. At the end of the column, the script finds the average r, g, and b values by dividing by the number of pixels it sampled. This average color is drawn as a 1x1 rectangle at the start of the row. The column scan is done for every column in the image until what remains is a single-pixel tall by source image-wide row of pixels. It's a little confusing, but to get a row of pixels you need to sample all the columns. A similar effect can be generated by taking an image in a photo editor and compressing its height to one pixel. The effect may be slightly different, but this is sort of what's happening. 

vMean (Vertical Mean): Like hMean, but this time the scans are taken on a row-by-row basis until we're left with a very tall image of pixel-tall and image-width long rows.
